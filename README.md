# Frontend Mentor - Age calculator app solution

Hi everybody! 👋
This is a solution to the [Age calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/age-calculator-app-dF9DFFpj-Q).

- PS:  I don’t quite understand how to animate the transition of numbers (bonus of the challenge), if anyone could guide me at this point I would thank them.
- PS2: if someone wanted to check my javascript code and suggest how to improve it would be great.
Saludos!

## Overview

### The challenge  🎯

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process ⚙️

### Built with 🛠️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned 📚

This work was a real challenge when testing my skills with javascript, mainly when I had to create the functionalities of error messages for inputs and also to assemble the age calculation.
With this challenge I began to get into the management of functions and calculations.

### Continued development 🔨

In the following challenges I want to improve my javascript skills.
I must strengthen my knowledge and management of functions, field validation and much more.
